###How to test

- `npm install`
If you make any changes in the `src` directory, run:
- `webpack && webpack --config webpack.example.config.js`

###Description

This is a super simple react component that will strip any non alpha-numeric characters for you. It will turn spaces into dashes. 
This is my first real react component I've published, so please let me know if you have any suggestions! 
You can rebuild the component with just `webpack` and rebuild the example by doing `webpack --config webpack.example.config.js`
